# Many of the configuration items in Metamapper are centralized to the Django settings.py
# files. You can use this file to override those settings.
#
# This file is referenced by default, but you can also reference a different settings file
# through the METAMAPPER_SETTINGS_OVERRIDE_MODULE environment variable.
